Based on the response from Stripe, the checkout session appears to have been created successfully with the session ID cs_test_a1hczLxlRvEDkn086kaHSJwQQmdVN2bIYBkwAfZMeMMsDaAsH0peQ4eqhE. However, there are a few things to check and troubleshoot since you mentioned facing an error.

Key Points:
Status: The session status is open, which means it should be available for use.
Payment Status: The payment status is unpaid, which is expected until the customer completes the payment process.
URL: The URL for the checkout session is provided (https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_a1hczLxlRvEDkn086kaHSJwQQmdVN2bIYBkwAfZMeMMsDaAsH0peQ4eqhE).
Potential Issues and Fixes:
Session Expiration:

The session expires at the UNIX timestamp 1726002495, which you can convert to a readable date format to check if the session is still valid. If the session has expired, you'll need to create a new one.
Test Mode:

The session is created in test mode (livemode: false). Ensure you are using the correct API keys for either test or live mode, depending on your environment.
URL Issue:

The link itself seems valid, but if you're still experiencing issues, try using the direct checkout session link: https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_a1hczLxlRvEDkn086kaHSJwQQmdVN2bIYBkwAfZMeMMsDaAsH0peQ4eqhE.

Open the link in an incognito/private browser window to avoid cache or session issues.

Cancel and Success URLs:

The cancel_url and success_url are set to http://localhost:8000/payment and http://localhost:8000/app, respectively. Make sure that your server is running locally, and these routes are correctly handled. If you are testing this on a different environment (not localhost), make sure the URLs are updated to reflect the current domain.
Check Stripe Logs:

Go to your Stripe Dashboard and review the logs for this session. Look for any errors or warnings that could provide more insight into why the checkout isn't proceeding as expected.
Payment Method:

The payment methods allowed are card and link. Make sure that the card information entered during the checkout is correct and valid.
Next Steps:
Test in a new environment: Use the checkout link in an incognito window or a different browser.
Confirm URL Handling: Ensure the cancel_url and success_url are pointing to valid routes that handle the respective actions properly.
Check for Expiration: Ensure the session has not expired by verifying the expiration timestamp.
